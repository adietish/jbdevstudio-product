This release .zip file can be used to install additional JBoss Developer Studio and third-party features available from JBoss Central into your existing JBoss Developer Studio 9 or ${eclipse.version} installation. 

The IDE can install these features directly from an online update site but this file provides you with an alternative to the online update site in the case that you want to work offline. 

The release .zip file was built with ${eclipse.version} but it should also work with future Eclipse 4.5 (Mars) versions.
