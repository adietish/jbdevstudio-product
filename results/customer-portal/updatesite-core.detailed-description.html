This release .zip file can be used to install JBoss Developer Studio features into your existing JBoss Developer Studio 8.x or ${eclipse.version} installation. 

The IDE can install these features directly from an online update site but this file provides you with an alternative to the update site in the case that you want to work offline. 

The release .zip file was built with ${eclipse.version} but it should also work with future Eclipse 4.4 (Luna) versions.
