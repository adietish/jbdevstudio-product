The Red Hat JBoss Development Suite includes everything you need to start working with the Red Hat Container Development Kit and Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio, including OpenJDK 8, Cygwin, PuTTY, and OpenShift Client (OC) Tools. 

It requires Vagrant 1.7.4 and Virtual Box 5.0.8 or later, but will install them for you if not already present on your 64-bit Windows system if a network is available.

This installer has been tested by Red Hat, with documentation describing known issues.
